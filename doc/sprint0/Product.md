# Calypso

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?
A vibrant platform that is an online marketplace for all forms of art. Currently, there are several platforms for different art types, but no single platform that brings together all artforms. For example, users can search for music via Spotify, but must find photos via Pinterest. While using Calypso, users can search for beats for their music and even look for art for their album covers. Our platform grants users easy access to all mediums of art, to support up-and-coming artists and make an impact on the art community. Users can both buy and sell all art forms such as drawings, pictures, videos, games, songs, animations, etc and interact with other members of the community. 


#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)
See personas.pdf in doc/sprint0

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users would choose our product for ease of use and convenience. Users currently utilize various apps such as Spotify or SoundCloud for music, Pinterest for digital art and websites such as Artsy.net for purchasing art. By using Calypso, users no longer require various accounts on multiple apps to satisfy their artistic needs. This saves the user time as they no longer need to browse several applications for their art desires. Further, artists such as music creators save hours of time since they can request beats from others artists directly via our platform after listening to the artist's samples. For our art lovers, engaging with our platform provides the exciting oppourtunity of discovering new artists whose work they enjoy. They are also allowed to reach out to artists directly, requesting commissions, customized pieces or even to support them. 


#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 
Our team agrees that this means all user stories are implemented, all implemented features are tested with a wide range of test cases, and there are no bugs in the product.

### Highlights

1. Our group was formed through the combination of two groups, and we set up a Discord server for communication. 

2. A major discussion that came up during our first meeting was choosing between one of the projects suggested in class and creating our own. If we chose to do one of the projects that were given to us, we would have more guidance and aid in the development of the project. However, we would not have full creative control. If we were to create our own project, then we would have control over the full project. Also, we would be able to change and implement features that we want in the end product. Ultimately we decided to create our own project, due to the creative freedom that we would get with it. 

3. A key decision we made in envisioning our project was whether to target a specific form of art or all art forms. We agreed that a specific art form would make it easier to find a target audience and market it as such. However, we ultimately decided to include all forms of art in an effort to provide a unique platform that connects all types of artists and art enjoyers.

4. Due to in person classes during the day, we decided to have 10 minute long standups at 8pm daily, starting from sprint 1. During these standups we would discuss what we did since the previous standup, any problems we encountered and what weâ€™re going to do by the next standup.
