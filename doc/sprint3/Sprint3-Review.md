## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * Start date: 12th July 2023
 * End date: 21st July 2023
 * Demo: 21st July 2023
 * Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection

In this sprint, we got a lot of main features completed such as:
Login and register with error messages and creation of users in both mongodb and neo4j
Sorting features for product page
Recommendation algorithm for music for different each user 
Allowing new users to choose their new name, banner picture, profile picture ect..
Allowing users to add products to their cart 
Users can send messages 

By completing most of these we have a base app that we are very proud of. Now, for our last sprint, we are able to place our focus on very specific features that will make our app unique. 

### Decisions that turned out well

A decision that turned out well was our decision to reduce the amount of sprint meetings we have during the sprint. We cut it down to 5 meetings. We had hoped that this reduction would allow for members to make more meaningful contributions each sprint rather than having a sprint meeting everyday and hearing repetitive or minor updates. What we found by reducing the amount of sprint meetings was that the members were able to report more meaningful updates and that members were able to attend all the meetings so the decision was a success.

By working on perfecting our base features in sprint 0-3, we can now use sprint 4 to perfect different features that will make our app stand out 

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

We planned to finish the Transactions, but didnâ€™t take into consideration all the prerequisite features that needed to get done before we started on Transactions so we had to pivot into other work mid sprint

Not putting in more mock data into the databases made it so that we had to spend unnecessary time in the sprint adding mock data so that our features would work properly


### Planned changes

- At the beginning of the sprint all members will now break down their task into subtasks so that our efforts are better measured

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Hashing passwords[cal-109]
- Users being able to log in [cal-72]
- Navigate to other users 
- Messaging functionality
- Shopping cart for products [cal-126]
- Add Search/Sort/Filter options for Artworks page 
- Implement Music recommendation feature [cal-123]

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- Being notified when a user buys/bids on a product, this was not implemented because it took longer than expected to implement messaging, logged in user and product / bidding functionality.
- Stripe API: We did not realize all the work we needed to get done first because the Stripe API depends on those features such as shopping cart.
- Bidding functionality: After the planning stage and some initial, we realized that this is a huge feature that requires a lot of work so we decided that we needed more people to work on it so we pushed it to the next sprint
- Reset password: We later decided to prioritze bigger features that would make our app unique
 

## Meeting Highlights

1. We would be placing more focus on the features that make our app unique. Since we only have one sprint left it would be best to make our app stand out from other apps by focusing on features such as art recommendation feature, messaging feature, showcase feature, preview beats feature

2. We would be placing more focus on creating all subtasks at the beginning of the sprint instead of during the sprint. This way we can properly determine how long / how much effort a task needs
