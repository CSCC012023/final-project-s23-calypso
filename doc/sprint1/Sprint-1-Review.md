## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Jun 16, 2023
 * Where: Online (Zoom)

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

During this sprint the work was evenly split into 7 main tasks. Due to this, everyone contributed evenly and was able to complete their task. We think that this sprint was overall successful. 

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Focusing only on functionality over design saved us a lot of time and took off a lot of pressure
Splitting the tasks up and letting each person work on only one page made it so that there were minimal to no conflicts
Designing the UI beforehand on Figma really helped save time when designing the pages/components
Choosing to use Tailwind CSS has saved us a lot of time in writing/styling components







#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Not having a document to track all the styling, sizes, spacing for headers, subheadings, etc. Everyoneâ€™s style is a little different
Changing menu bar halfway into sprint


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

Planning on getting 2 reviewers for each pull request since the second sprint of linking to the database brings in more room for error. Initially, 2 reviewers were planned but we were only allowed 1 reviewer on github. We are planning to find out more to change this.  
Planning on completing sprint documentations within the first week of the sprint to get a better feel of what exactly we are supposed to submit. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

Got real time search to work for Image browsing

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

Planned to do user authentication for the login page but did not get to that yet since we placed the focus mainly on getting the basic UI of the pages set up. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
