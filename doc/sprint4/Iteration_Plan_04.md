# Calypso

## Iteration 04

 * Start date: 24th July 2023
 * End date: 4th August 2023

## Process

For this sprint, since it is our last sprint, we have decided to plan our tasks, subtasks and responsibilities all on the first day of the sprint. Further, we also decided to have more stand up meetings so that communication is even better during our last sprint and since we are now working in pairs rather than separately.

#### Changes from previous iteration

1. We all planned our tasks, sub tasks and responsibilities on day one 

2. We are now working in pairs rather than individually in order to get more tasks covered in a shorter time, since there is a lot more to do to finish our project this sprint 

3. We have planned 6 stand up meetings as opposed to 5 in order to better facilitate communication between group

#### Roles & responsibilities

Every team member will be doing both front end and back end development for their assigned user stories. The different services and persons assigned as follows:

- William & Maaneth: Analytics Page
- Austin & Shadman: Products / Transactions / Shopping Cart
- Tasif: Help Cassy with Messages and Help others if they need help
- Cassandra: Messaging 
- Ariell & Maaneth : UI Improvements for all pages
- Maaneth: Music implementation and UI assistance 


#### Events

Meetings will be held online on discord, to discuss our next steps and any difficulties. Regular standup meetings will occur 6 times during this sprint, all at 8pm via discord. Two code review meetings will be held where we discuss what we did and explain the code we wrote to others / help other members if needed.

#### Artifacts

- We will use JIRA to keep track of our progress on stories and which stories need to get done
- Jira will also be used to list any new subtasks that must be completed in order to complete the user story
- The highest priority tasks would be the ones which are the foundation of the app but since this is the last sprint we also have to make sure the app looks clean and presentable.


#### Git / GitHub workflow

The workflow is as follows: 
1. Pull the latest version of main from github to local version and create a branch
2. Name the branch as the user story number or even subtask number, along with a short description if needed. 
3. Publish the branch. 
4. Work on code. Commit as needed throughout your process, to this branch. 
5. If someone pushes and merges new changes while working on this branch, ensure to pull those changes to branch 
6. When all code is completed, ensure all commits are made, and create a pull request and request the review of a fellow team member.
7. Reviewers must check out the newly published branch, and review all changes made by peers. 
8. After changes / suggestions are made (if any), the reviewer will approve of the pull request. The team member that created the pull request is responsible for merging their new code to main. 
9. Notify the team that your changes are merged so that others can pull to their branch.
