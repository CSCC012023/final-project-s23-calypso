## Iteration 04 - Review & Retrospect

 * When:  Aug 4, 2023
 * Where: Online (Zoom)

## Process - Reflection

For this Sprint we focused on refining our features, and creating a more consistent application in terms of user experience. This sprint, we also decided to assign two persons to each task so that the work can be efficiently completed.

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Working in pairs was a good decision because this sprint we had many tasks that were related to each other, so working in pairs really helped us to complete our tasks (for example the dashboard tasks, UI tasks, messaging, and product/bidding tasks were split between two pairs, and we made good progress on all of them)

2. Having Maaneth and Tasif help other members with their tasks and general UI changes helped ease the load off all the members

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

No bad decisions this sprint


#### Planned changes

No process related changes
