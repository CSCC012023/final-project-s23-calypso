## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

* July 7, 2023
* Zoom

## Process - Reflection

For this sprint we created mock data, created a database to store user data, and were able to get and put changes onto the database. 

### Decisions that turned out well

1. Deciding to use a mix of Neo4j and MongoDB was a good decision because it makes the product/user recommendation services a lot easier to implement

2. Keeping user authentication service in MongoDB was a good decision because there is a lot of documentation and safety benefits to using MongoDB

3. Adding subtasks to all the stories made it easier to track the progress of stories and helped us estimate more accurately 



### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Assigned too many user stories and we underestimated how hard and how much time the stories would take

2. Took a longer than than expected when deciding and testing whether it was better to use MongoDB, Neo4j or both. After serveral team discussions and meeting with prof, we decided on using both

3. Progress was hindered when transitioning from 4 different databases to 2 databases


### Planned changes

1. Plan on making JIRA more organized and up to date so that we can more accurately track our progress.  This is because in the last sprint, a lot of stories were not updated in JIRA and it made for an overestimation of story points this sprint. 

2. Updated our work flow to including the ticket number in branch names and commit messages since it allows us to be more organized and keep track of what stories are currently being worked on 


## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Completed connection to MongoDB: See user story Cal-3 subtask Cal-64
- Completed connection to Neo4j: This was not an original part of the sprint since we only intended to use MongoDB at the begining of this sprint
- Completed first iteration of messaging page: See user story Cal-10
- Completed first iteration of iteration of transactions page


### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- lanned to get every page/service connected to a database, but it took longer than expected so we didn’t meet our goal 

- Planned to do a lot more stories, however we underestimated how much we could complete

- Planned to get all mock data in the databases but since we took a long time setting them up, we didn’t get to complete this


## Meeting Highlights

* Going into the next sprint our main focus would be placed on connecting our front-end and back-end for all services. This sprint we spent a lot of time last sprint deciding whether SQL or NoSQL databases should be used, and which NoSQL databases were best suited for our needs. 

* Due to the underestimation of the efforts required for our user stories, for the next iteration we will each place our focus on one user story and list out the subtasks that will help us in estimating the effort required to complete
